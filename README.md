# StudyFlip

StudyFlip is a single-page web application that allows you to create, study, and test yourself on custom flashcards. It’s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using `localStorage` to save your decks and cards so you never lose your progress upon leaving or refreshing the page.

**Features:**

- **Create and Manage Decks:**  
  Users can create new decks, name them, and add as many flashcards as they like.
- **Flashcard Study Mode:**  
  Flip each card to reveal the answer. Navigate through the deck to study all the cards you’ve created.
- **Multiple-Choice Test Mode:**  
  Convert your deck into a quiz. Each question is your flashcard term, and the answers are multiple-choice options derived from your deck’s answers.
- **Persistence with Local Storage:**  
  All data is stored locally in `localStorage`, ensuring the data persists even when you leave or refresh the page.
